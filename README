            extention = asf
                All stream output files will be fitted with this extention
            command = mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile $FILE $URL
                The command to stream and dump with. The command will be used
                per stream capture as is. The resulting filename will be

            pretime_minutes = 5
                This setting lets the timer load the stream x minutes prior to 
                the time.
            overtime_minutes = 5
                This setting lets the timer stop the stream x minutes after the
